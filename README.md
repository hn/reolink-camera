# Reolink RLC-410-5MP IP camera

## Preamble
The Reolink RLC-410-5MP is a 2560x1920 pixel IP camera with infrared night vision, motion detection and PoE support.
The hardware of the camera is quite good (well designed metal casing, multi-layer PCB with high soldering quality).
The software is ~~bad (requiring Flash Player is not acceptable under any circumstances)~~ ok-ish, but not as bad as other cameras I've seen before.
The camera [offers](https://reolink.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Reolink-CGI-command-v1.61.pdf)
[RTMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-Time_Messaging_Protocol) and [RTSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_Streaming_Protocol) video
streams. The RTSP stream suffers from various problems ("melting" and "smearing")
when used with non-Reolink video players.

## Hardware

The camera uses a [Novatek NV98515](http://www.novatek.com.tw/en-global/) SoC (MIPS 24KEc V5.5
architecture, dual core with MMU, 640MHz, H.264/265 video encoding, encryption engine)
with a [Omnivision OS05A10M](https://www.ovt.com/sensors/OS05A10) image sensor. The firmware is stored on
a 16 MiB [GD25Q127C](https://www.gigadevice.com/datasheet/gd25q127c/)
[SPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface)
[NOR flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory#NOR_flash).

There probably exist different hardware versions (image sensors) of this
camera (`if ${SENSOR} == "CMOS_SC5035M" .. elif .. "CMOS_OV4689M" .. elif .. "CMOS_OS05A10M"` - The OV4689
ist a 4MP sensor).

### Serial port

There is a `115200 8-N-1` serial port accessible via `J9`:

![Serial port](reolink-rlc-410-5mp-serial.jpg "Reolink RLC-410-5MP serial port")

## Firmware

The firmware is based on Novatek's NA51023 NVT evaluation board SDK (`U-Boot 2014.07`,
`kernel 4.1.0` and a Linux base system based on [Buildroot 2015.11.1-00003-gfd1edb1](https://buildroot.org/)).
See [U-Boot bootloader](log-u-boot.txt) and [Linux misc](log-linux.txt) logfiles for more details.

There is a [ÂµITRON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITRON_project)-compatible
[eCos-RTOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECos) running on CPU1 (image capturing and video encoding),
and Linux running on CPU2 (networking and web frontend application).
The eCos firmware is stored in binary files `FW98515A.bin FW98515T.bin FW98515A.ext.bin`.
Communication between the two cores is orchestrated by the `NVT IPC` framework and shared memory.

Boot process: CPU1 runs the `loader` image from partition 0 and initializes
basic I/O and RAM. CPU1 reads uboot image from partition 3 and triggers CPU2
to execute the uboot boot process. When the linux kernel image has been
started, CPU2 signals CPU1 to start image capturing.

Novatek does not release _any_ information about their products. One can find
some brief [datasheet of the NT96650](https://dashcamtalk.com/cams/mobius/Novatek%20NT96650.pdf)
and some [discussion and tools at GoPrawn forum](https://www.goprawn.com/forum/novatek-cams).

### Reolink Camera API

One can disable the OSD watermark (without flash interface) with [this small script](api-disable-watermark.sh).

Alano Terblanche has more complete [Python API implementation](https://github.com/Benehiko/ReolinkCameraAPI).

### Unpack firmware

Firmware `RLC-410-5MP_448_19061407` is available from Reolink's support website.
With [unpack-novatek-firmware.pl](unpack-novatek-firmware.pl) one can download the firmware file
and extract bootloader, kernel and root filesystem:

```

### Compile additional software

Download [Buildroot 2015.11.1](https://buildroot.org/downloads/buildroot-2015.11.1.tar.gz)
(Novatek's SDK uses this version and newer Buildroot releases use a newer/incompatible uClibc).
Exec `make menuconfig`, select `Target options`, change `Target Architecture`
to `MIPS (little endian)` and `Target Architecture Variant` to `mips 32`.
Select `Target packages` in the main menu and select packages as needed.
Exit and `make`.

### Modify rootfs / add SSH daemon

Use [repack-reolink-rootfs.sh](repack-reolink-rootfs.sh) to repack the (read-only) rootfs on flash partition 6.
Dump squashfs with `cat /dev/mtdblock6 > /mnt/sda/mtdblock6.bin` to SD card
first. Then execute the script on your Linux workstation like this:

```
$ ./repack-reolink-rootfs.sh

mtdblock6-NEW.bin file size (65536-byte aligned): 0x610000

Execute the following commands within u-boot:

fatload mmc 0 0x1000000 mtdblock6-NEW.bin
sf erase 0x6e0000 0x610000
sf write 0x1000000 0x6e0000 0x610000
reset
```

Then write the modified squashfs to NOR flash of your camera as shown in
script output:

:warning: Warning: Starting firmware version `v3.0.0.65_20071000` the flash layout has changed, you have to change start offset from `0x6e0000` to `0x620000`. Double-check first, otherwise you'll brick your device!

```

SF: 6356992 bytes @ 0x6e0000 Written: OK
NA51023> reset
```

There's something broken within dropbear's key initial exchange (causing a segfault). You
might need to login using `ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=ssh-rsa root@ipaddress`
for the very first time. I don't have time to debug this odd behaviour.

Enjoy logging in to your camera with SSH.

- With `get_sysinfo` debug information about the various video streams
is displayed, see [sample output](log-get_sysinfo.txt).

- The camera uses [nginx](http://nginx.org/) as web server. The RTMP stream is
orchestrated by the [rtmp-module](https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module).

- The [LIVE555 Media Server](http://www.live555.com/mediaServer/) is used
  for RTSP streaming.

- One can find various info about the [NT98515 on Lxnicks's chinese 
  website](https://lxnick.wordpress.com/tag/nt98515/).

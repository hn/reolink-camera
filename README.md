# Reolink RLC-410-5MP IP camera

## Preamble
The Reolink RLC-410-5MP is a 2560x1920 pixel IP camera with infrared night vision, motion detection and PoE support.
The hardware of the camera is quite good (well designed metal casing, multi-layer PCB with high soldering quality).
The software is bad (requiring Flash Player is not acceptable under any circumstances), but not as bad as other cameras I've seen before.
The camera [offers](https://reolink.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Reolink-CGI-command-v1.61.pdf)
[RTMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-Time_Messaging_Protocol) and [RTSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_Streaming_Protocol) video
streams. The RTSP stream suffers from various problems ("melting" and "smearing").

## Hardware

The camera uses a [Novatek NV98515](http://www.novatek.com.tw/en-global/) SoC (MIPS 24KEc V5.5 architecture) with a [Omnivision OS05A10M](https://www.ovt.com/sensors/OS05A10) image sensor. The firmware is stored on a 16 MiB [GD25Q127C](https://www.gigadevice.com/datasheet/gd25q127c/) [SPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface) [NOR flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory#NOR_flash).

### Serial port

There is a `115200 8-N-1` serial port accessible via `J9`:

## Firmware

The firmware is based on Novatek's NVT evaluation board SDK (`U-Boot 2014.07`, `kernel 4.1.0` and a Linux base system based on [Buildroot 2015.11.1-00003-gfd1edb1](https://buildroot.org/)). See [U-Boot bootloader](log-u-boot.txt) and [Linux misc](log-linux.txt) logfiles for more details.

There is a [ÂµITRON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITRON_project)-compatible [eCos-RTOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECos) running on CPU1 (probably doing the video encoding work), and Linux running on CPU2 (`-D_CPU1_UITRON -D_CPU2_LINUX`).

Novatek does not release _any_ information about their products. One can find
some brief [datasheet of the NT96650](https://dashcamtalk.com/cams/mobius/Novatek%20NT96650.pdf)
and some [discussion and tools at GoPrawn forum](https://www.goprawn.com/forum/novatek-cams).

### Unpack firmware

Firmware `RLC-410-5MP_448_19061407` is available from Reolink's support website. With [unpack-reolink-firmware.sh](unpack-reolink-firmware.sh) one can download the firmware file and extract the root filesystem:

```
$ ./unpack-reolink-firmware.sh

### Extend firmware

Download [Buildroot 2015.11.1](https://buildroot.org/downloads/buildroot-2015.11.1.tar.gz)
(I suggest to choose version 2015.11.1 as Novatek's SDK uses this as well).
Exec `make menuconfig`, select `Target options`, change `Target Architecture`
to `MIPS (little endian)` and `Target Architecture Variant` to `mips 32`.
Select `Target packages` in the main menu and select packages as needed.
Exit and `make`.
